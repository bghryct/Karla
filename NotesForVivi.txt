The entire project was basically expanding Karla from 4 -> 12 weights and drawing additional characters to meet the fb glyphset requirements at the time. which I think was gf+

Karla had been ported to a project Karmilla which was using fontforge files if I recall correctly. I converted it back to glyphs. 

Removed extraneous masters, and tried to land everything on the same advance widths as before. Things were a little different, with a shift from 1000 to 2000 upm, but not enough to be 'noticeable'. Also the changes were deemed necessary for the goal of expanding the range of styles. 


requirements.txt probably needs to be updated if you're going to use a requirements.txt
otherwise it can probably be trashed

stat table fixing hasn't been done

name needs to be brought forward to the present convention i.e.

Karla[wght].ttf
Karla-Italic[wght].ttf

probably has fails now as fontbakery has updated several times since the initial pr. 

nothing critical in terms of the drawing should be present. 

The Readme needs to be updated. Should probably say (Karla is a combination of the original Karla, and Karmilla, an offshoot of Karla)
Idk how important that is. 

The Fontlogs should probably be merged.
